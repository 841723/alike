# Alike Compiler

"Alike" is a language invented by University professors that bears similarity to Ada. 

A compiler has been developed to translate Alike code into intermediate code that can be interpreted by the p-machine.

The document ```alike.pdf``` outlines the rules and specifications of the language.
